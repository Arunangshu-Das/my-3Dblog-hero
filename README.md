# 3D React App with Higher Order Component and Three.js

This is a sample README.md file for a React application that utilizes a Higher Order Component (HOC) and Three.js for rendering a vertical timeline. The application is a portfolio website with sections like About, Experience, Tech, Works, and Contact.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arunangshu-Das/my-3Dblog-hero.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

## Features

- The UI components are organized in the `components` directory, which includes `About`, `Contact`, `Experience`, `Feedbacks`, `Hero`, `Navbar`, `Tech`, `Works`, `Techs`, and `StarsCanvas`.
- The `Navbar` and `Hero` components are displayed on the home page.
- The `About`, `Experience`, `Tech`, `Works`, `Techs`, and `Contact` components are displayed sequentially on the page.
- The `Feedbacks` component is commented out and can be used if feedback functionality is needed.

## Three.js Integration

- The `StarsCanvas` component utilizes Three.js to render a dynamic starry background. The stars move subtly, creating a sense of depth and immersion.
- The `StarsCanvas` component is included on the `Contact` section of the page.

## Higher Order Component (HOC)

- The application uses a Higher Order Component (HOC) to enhance the functionality of certain components. However, the specific details and implementation of the HOC are not provided in this code snippet.

## Credits

- This project was developed by [Arunangshu Das](https://github.com/Arunangshu-Das).
- The starry background in the `StarsCanvas` component is created using Three.js, a 3D library.
